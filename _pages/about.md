# Biography
---
I am now an Assistant professor in [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.njust.edu.cn) of [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://www.njust.edu.cn), where I am a member of [IMAG](https://imag-njust.net). I received my doctoral degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) under the supervision Prof. [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/#) in 2023, and received my B.E. degree from [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn) in 2018. Now, I have served as the reviewer for top-tier conferences, including NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, and ICML.

# Research Interests
---
My research interests include various topics in deep learning, especially the **explainablity of deep learning**.
Work related to these topics have been publised in top-tier conferences and journals, including **TPAMI, NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, and AAAI**.

# Looking for Students and Partnership
---
â€‹I am looking for highly motivated students (PhD, master, undergraduate students) to work together on machine learning and Explainable AI, especially theoretical/experimental explanation of the inference logic/representation capacity of DNNs, and reliable guidance for improving the performance. Please feel free to send me your CV, if you have interest.

I am also actively looking for partnership so that we can together make the impossible possible :)
