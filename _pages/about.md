# Biography 
---
I am now an Assistant Professor in [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.njust.edu.cn) of [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://www.njust.edu.cn), where I am a member of [IMAG](https://imag-njust.net). I received my doctoral degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Dr. [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/#) in 2023, and received my B.E. degree from [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn) in 2018. Morever, I have served as the reviewer for top-tier conferences and journals, including TPAMI, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, ICCV, AAAI and TMLR.




# Research Interests 
---
My research interests include various topics in deep learning, especially the **explainablity of deep learning**.  
Work related to these topics has publised in top-tier conferences and journals, including **TPAMI, NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ICCV, and AAAI**.



# Looking for Students and Partnership
___
​I am looking for highly motivated students (Ph.D, master, undergraduate students) to work together on machine learning and Explainable AI, especially theoretical/experimental explanation of the inference logic/representation capacity of DNNs, and reliable guidance for improving the performance. Please feel free to send me your CV (_**xcheng8@njust.edu.cn**_), if you have interest.

I am actively looking for partnership so that we can together make the impossible possible :)

_**招收硕士生、本科实习生，欢迎对人工智能充满兴趣的学生联系我，课题组内具有浓厚的学术氛围，我将为每一位学生供系统而深入的科研指导、丰厚的科研补贴与奖励、充足的计算资源等，优秀者可以支持海外学术交流与工作推荐，
请将简历发送至邮箱xcheng8@njust.edu.cn。**_
